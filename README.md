# About this Project

This is Dev Career Personality Test, a project inspired by peachnono's [Career Personality Test](https://github.com/peachnono/dev-personality-test). 

It functions similarly to personality tests like the Enneagram and MBTI tests, but this personality test will let users know about their ideal career path in IT based on their answers to the questions in the test. The results of the test were based on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). 

The test does not intend to stereotype people with certain personality traits to take up a particular role; this test only offers suggestions for people who are undecided on which career path to take.
